All the statements that should be in the body of the function need to be indented the exact same number of spaces (usually 4), most Python editors know to automatically indent lines in a group, but they don't know when you are done with the grouping, so it's up to you to un-indent when you are done closing the body.\n",

To help you out, the letters of the alphabet have been provided.  The next cell provides an outline of the steps in English.  Working through the logic in English first can make solving problems a bit easier.  Try working through the steps one by one and translating each line into the Python code that executes the action.

    "## `while` Statements\n",
    "You have already seen an example of the `while` statement a bit earlier, but it is helpful to address again briefly.  The `while` statement is useful when the condition that is being tested happens in the code block of the loop.  For instance, `while` loops are often used when reading lines from a file.  \n",

    "In this case, we bootstrap the value of `line` to be an empty string, then we tell Python to continue to execute the code block until the iteration when the value of `line` has no more value.  If we were to do this with a `for` loop, we would need to know ahead of time how many lines were in the file or have a specific number of lines in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "One more common use of `while` is to avoid getting bad data from user inputs.  So for instance, the next cell shows an example of asking the user to specify a value between 1-10.  So long as the user doesn't provide a valid value, the prompt is repeated.\n",

This is common when we are starting to write our code and we want a placeholder or we aren't sure what to do just yet, but we want to be syntactically correct.  This is where we can use the keyword `pass` similar to comments, this is skipped over by the computer, but makes sure that our code works correctly.\n",
