## How to use this book
Most of the content in this book is meant to be read and evaluated.  The code samples have typically already been run and have the results available immediately.  If you are interested in running these samples in a live environment, making changes to try new things or experimenting with the content - which we definitely encourage! - then you need to open the pages in either JupyterHub (preferred) or Binder.  The pages available to be openned in these platforms will be
