# Python For Analytics

This book represents a collection of learning modules and exercises to help students learning Python in order to do analytics.

## How to use this book
Most of the content in this book is meant to be read and evaluated.  If you are reading this on the [py4analytics](https://www.py4analytics.info/) website, the code samples and the results available immediately.  If you are interested in running these samples in a live environment, making changes to try new things or experimenting with the content (which we definitely encourage!) then you need to open the pages in either JupyterHub (preferred) or Binder.  The pages available to be opened in these platforms will be copied from the source directly into the environment.  From there you can edit, run, download, copy etc.

### Running pages on JupyterHub
There are two options for running on JupyterHub depending on whether you have a University of Arkansas credential.

If you have credentials for the University of Arkansas, then on pages with a rocket ship, you can simply select - Run on JupyterHub.  when you select this option, the pages will be copied onto a University managed server for your account. From there you can run cells, make changes, add new cells and adjust the code.
