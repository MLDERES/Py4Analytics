# Part 1 - Basic Python

In order to communicate with a computer we need a language that is understandble by both humans and computers.  One popular language to do this is Python (named after the English comedy troupe Monty Python).  Python is popular because of it's english-like phrasing and limited symbols/special characters.  The goal of the language designer is to encourage verbosity and clarity.  Things should be obvious and simple.

This on-line resource starts with a basic introduction to the language syntax items and demonstrates some of the common patterns that make this language useful and popular.  This is not a definitive guide into all that Python has to offer (no book can cover all of that), but it focuses instead on practical skills for using Python to automate data analysis leaving the depth to the reader to investigate.
