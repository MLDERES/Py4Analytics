    "# Reusing Code\n",
    "One of the fundamental skills that every programmer must have is the ability to make their code reusable.  Not just cut/paste reusable, but being able to be reused with in a variety of conditions without having to rework the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you think about a simple task, like making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, you can ask your friend to make that sandwich with just a few words, like \"Would you make me a sandwich?\".  This works because we are often taught how to do simple tasks as we grow up.  But what if your friend has never made a sandwich before?  Then it might take a few more instructions such as:\n",
    "  \n",
    "- First, get the peanut butter from the pantry\n",
    "- Get the grape jelly from the refrigerator\n",
    "- Grab the white bread off the counter\n",
    "- Spread the PB on one slice of bread and the jelly on another\n",
    "- Fold the bread slices together with the PB and jelly touching\n",
    "\n",
    "Even here we've shortcut a bunch of steps?  For instance, \"get the peanut butter from the pantry\" means _go to the pantry, open the door, finding the jar, grabbing the jar, walk back, put it on the counter_...\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine now if your friend came over once a week for a PB&J and we had to explain how to do each of these steps every time.  It wouldn't take more than once or twice for us to figure out that it might be best to just write down the steps for our friend and give them the notecard of instructions to follow whenever they are hungry.  That would be helpful, but what if our friend gets sick of grape jelly and would prefer instead strawberry jam?  Or she would prefer her bread toasted first?  In that case we'd need to create new notecards for each combination of outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps us to understand quite a bit about how computers work and why our program is important.  Computers don't have a memory, so we do have to tell the computer each time all the steps each time we want to perform a particular task!  Just like our forgetful friend, the computer needs to be reminded of the steps to take every time.  What's more computers only do what we tell them to do (using programming languages).  If we told the computer to get the grape jelly from the fridge and there wasn't any grape jelly - our friend might automatically choose strawberry instead, the computer won't make this choice for us unless it's told that strawberry is suitable alternative to grape.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Computers can't fill in the blanks, we have to be very precise.  But we also don't want to have to be extremely precise everytime we want to do a simple task, so we use abstractions in programming to help us with the mundane.  One example, the `print()` statement we saw earlier.  There is a lot of stuff happening to make a couple of letters appear on the screen.  Fortunately for us, someone else figured this out already and we can rely on their work.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Functions (in other languages called subroutines) are self-contained lines of code which accomplish a specific task.  Functions can \"take in\" data, process it, and then \"return\" a result.\n",

    "## Defining Functions\n",

    "\n",
    "In the next cell, we have defined a function named `say_hello_world`.  Notice how it has the `def` keyword, the name of the function, `()` and a `:`?  The body of the function, the code which is executed when we call (run) the function, consists of all the lines in function code block."

As a caller of the function we can use the returned value just like we use variables, we can assign it to variable for safe-keeping, pass it along to another function or ignore it all together."

Finally, our function does something useful and sends back the result `c`.

    "<li><b>Documenting your function is a must.</b><br/>  You may not believe this now, but even the best programmers forget how their function is supposed to work or what it was supposed to do when the come back to use it a few days, months or years later.  The convention in Python is to write documentation comments immediately after the function definition.</li>\n",

Which format you choose is mostly up to you, although sometimes a project will already have defined the standard when you get to work on it.<div>\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "<li><b>Function names, and their parameters should be as descriptive as possible.</b><br/> While these examples above use parameter names like a and b (there is no reason to name them differently) the function names themselves immediately tell you the purpose and do exactly what you expect (add numbers, subtract numbers).</li>\n",
    "<li><b>Function names ought to use all lowercase letters and use '_' to separate words.</b><br/> If your function name is more than a single word, it is common practice (in Python, other languages differ) to separate the names with an `_` character.  For instance</li>\n",
