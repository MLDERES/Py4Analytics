    "Maybe it's worth noting (many notebooks leave these steps out because they are cumbersome and more complex to explain than to just do).  In a different notebook, I took a good look at the data to determine how to ensure that the data types were correct for each column.  You could do this in Excel (if your data is small enough) or you might use another tool where you can get a quick sample and try to understand the data.  For me, I took a look at the the types of data `cars_df.dtypes` then since I saw that many of the columns had just a 1 or a 0, I figured these were `boolean`.  Then looking at the names of the columns, like `Mfg_Year` and `Mfg_Month`, even though they are numbers, I felt it would be best to convert them what they are _ordinal_ values.  The other reason that this doesn't get much description is because the process is usually a bit non-linear and repeatitive.  For instance, once I determined the booleans, I converted them and then started looking for categoricals.  This would have taken 4 notebook cells (1. find bools, 2. convert columns to bool, 3. find non-bool number columns, 4. convert to ordinal).  As a reader you are really only interested in seeing the conversion of columns in a single cell instead of all the work behind it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example of the non-linear workflow, I discovered `Cylinders` as a unary value (all cars here have 4 cylinders).  If this column was dropped later in the notebook, then an update to the categorical columns as well.  Instead, I'll just let you know that I found this in a later step.  To be more clear, it was dropped immediately at the start before creating the categorical columns.  Additionally, I found later in the model that there are 300+ different car models in a dataset (within just 1400 rows), so this isn't going to be helpful later on either."
