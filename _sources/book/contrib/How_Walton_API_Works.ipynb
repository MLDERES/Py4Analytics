    "Then we establish a database connection using pyodbc and use environment variables to login. Environment variables are a common way to store sensitive information, such as passwords, in a secure manner. Environment variables are like variables in programming languages, which store a value that can be used by applications. The advantage of using environment variables to store sensitive information is that the information is not stored directly in the code or configuration files, so it is not easily accessible to anyone who might view the code or configuration files.

The code then prints the query, executes it using the cursor, and retrieves the query results as a list of rows.
