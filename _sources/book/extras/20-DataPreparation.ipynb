Most of our mathematical algorithms used in machine learning would give `calories` an inappropriately large influence on the outcome.  So we need to adjust for both of these to be on a similar scale.  This is where standardization and normalization comes in.  We can use a min/max normalization which will make each category on a scale from 0-1\n",

Normalization usually means to scale a variable to have a values between a desired range (like [-1,1] or [0,1]) while standardization transforms data to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1. Advantage of Normalization over Standardization is that we are not bound to any specific distribution. In addition to that Normalization also suppresses the effect of outliers to some extent._\n",

    "While preparing the data for machine learning, we often find that we either don't have enough features or we have way too many features to be valuable.  In both cases, we need to consider which features help us to describe the outcomes we are searching for.  We can often times do both tasks, creating new features [Feature Engineering](#feature-engineering) or reducing features through [Feature Selection](#feature-selection).  A brief overview is here, though we'll see more examples as we work through a few examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature Engineering\n",
    "Sometimes a set of predictors just doesn't provide enough variability on it's own and we would find value in breaking apart or finding new features in exisiting features.  One of the most obvious is time/date fields, these types of fields are filled with amazing data all locked up in what look like a single value.  Consider a date field for instance, with a date we can tell a whole lot of interesting things:\n",
    "- What day of the week is it?  (Mon, Tue, Wed..)\n",
    "- Which day of the month?  (1st, 10th, 21st ...)\n",
    "- Which month of the year? \n",
    "- Which season? (Spring, Summer ...)\n",
    "- What's the closest holiday, payday, birthday, significant event?\n",
    "- Is it a leap year? \n",
    "- Which week of the fiscal year?\n",
    "\n",
    "By exploring the dates on these dimensions we may find a better set of predictors or develop new insights into the quality/variability of our data.  The same thing works with time (hour of the day, night/day, morning/afternoon/evening).  These are easy and very common ways to create new insights into the data from a seemingly small set of predictors.  Check your data to see if there are hidden aspects as well!There are many, many different transformations and to add features to a dataset which has just a few features.  For instance, it may be necessary to consider the interaction between variables.  Consider, 2 categorical variables like movie genres.  While it would be helpful to look at each genre separately, it's possible that considering a movie of multiple genres is of interest.  Sci-Fi/Action movies or Romance/Comedy movies for instance.  We can see this combination by looking at dummy variables of course, but it might also be helpful to have a column for common 2 genre combinations or 3 genre combos.\n",

    "= combining continuous variables with simple math (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), \n",

For instance, if we are to create an image classifier, each pixel carries with it at least 3 pieces of information (red, green and blue values) or even more!  We can be overwhelmed with the number of dummy variables or simply the shear amount of data that is provided.  In these cases, we need to decide which are the most relevant pieces of data and which we can safely ignore.  Take for instance, the image classifier, the first row of pixels may be a black border on all the pictures - this doesn't help us there is no variability if all the images have the same black border.  We should therefore leave them out of the equation.  Or in the case of our movie generes, what if there is only 1 movie that is a Sci-Fi/Romance/Horror film?  This doesn't help us to find others like it.  In these cases, we need to reduce our set of features.\n",

    "A few algorithms handle this pretty well, Decision Trees in particular are good at ignoring variables have limited 'split' value and regression models [use a more brute force approach](https://towardsdatascience.com/feature-selection-techniques-in-regression-model-26878fe0e24e) (forward selection, backward elimination, stepwise selection).  For the ones that don't we can drop unary columns (those that don't change at all in all of our records), or use something like PCA ([principal components analysis](./41-AdvancedTechniques.ipynb#principal-components)) which is meant to capture as much of the variability as possible in just a few orthagonal vectors.\n",
