# Python For Analytics

This book represents a collection of learning modules and exercises to help students learning Python in order to do analytics.

## How to use this book
Most of the content in this book is meant to be read and evaluated.  If you are reading this on the [py4analytics](https://www.py4analytics.info/) website, the code samples and the results available immediately.  If you are interested in running these samples in a live environment, making changes to try new things or experimenting with the content (which we definitely encourage!) then you need to open the pages in either JupyterHub (preferred) or Binder.  The pages available to be opened in these platforms will be copied from the source directly into the environment.  From there you can edit, run, download, copy etc.

### Running pages on JupyterHub (with UA Credentials)
If you have credentials for the University of Arkansas, then on pages with a rocket ship, you can simply select - Run on JupyterHub.  when you select this option, the pages will be copied onto a University managed server for your account. From there you can run cells, make changes, add new cells and adjust the code.

### Running on Binder
Another simple option for running this set of notebooks is to use the [binder service](https://mybinder.org).  binder turns a Git repository into a collection of interactive notebooks.  Similar to the _launch on JupyterHub_ instructions, open any page where the rocket icon shows up and select __binder__.  This will create an environment on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/) with the latest version of the notebooks.

### Getting your own copy
If you have an different environment, would like to contribute, or just want to see how the sausage is made.  You can select the GitHub icon on any page which will take you to the GitHub repository.  From there you can fork the repo, download a copy or even open a [codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces).  The great thing about using the codespace example is that the entire environment is already set-up (nothing to install) and you will be able to immediately be able to run the notebooks with very little setup time.
