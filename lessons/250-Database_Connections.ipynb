    "# Working with relational database\n",
    "One common source of data, especially in institutions, is a relational database.  Microsoft SQL Server, Teradata, Oracle, Postgres, MySql are all examples of relational databases that are in common use for managing transactional data.  Storing and retrieving data from these servers is a regular task in the life of an analyst because any process that does anything interesting is likely to generate or ingest a lot of data.  In this notebook, we'll look at the main components of a database connection, how to establish a connection and put some data into a simple database and read some data out the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "````{note}\n",
    "SQL (pronounced S-Q-L or see-kwil) is the primary data manipulation language. This means SQL is the language we use to get/save data with a relational database.  You won't need an in-depth understanding of SQL to work through this notebook, but if you want to brush up on some of the basics, this is [a good resources](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp).\n",

    "## Definitions\n",
    "Before we start, let's define a few terms generically so that when you see them it becomes more clear what is happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Database Server** - A database server is the hardware which runs database software.  We will often refer to the database server as both the hardware and the software together.\n",
    "* **Database** - A database is a collection of tables, functions, procedures, et al, which allow access to the actual data.  The distinction between the server and the database are an important distinction, as a single *database server* can be hosting many *databases*.\n",
    "* **Connection** - in order to be able to run queries on a particular database, the client software needs to establish a connection to the database server/database combination.\n",
    "* **Cursor** - A database [cursor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursor_(databases)) is a mechanism which allows us to traverse the records in the database.  We can have many different cursors using the same connection to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to run a query\n",
    "There are a few basic steps in order to execute a query against a relational database.\n",
    "1. Establish a connection to the database\n",
    "2. Using the connection create a cursor upon which to execute one or more SQL commands\n",
    "3. Execute the SQL command using the cursor\n",
    "4. Assuming there is a result, process the results of the query\n",
    "5. The cursor may be reused if there are more commands to run\n",
    "6. When the operation is complete, close the connection\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to look at a few different approaches for making the connection to the database.  Which one you use will depend largely on the destination RDBMS server.  For instance some of the common protocols include ODBC, OLE-DB, and DBAPI.  We'll take a look at a couple of these here."

    "Arguably one of the simplest relational databases to work with in is the [SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database.  It is also one of the most used databases in the world.  It's built into every [mobile phone](https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html) and comes bundled in many applications people use on a regular basis.  It has many of the features of a more robust relational database, though the data is all stored in a single portable file format.\n",

A database [cursor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursor_(databases)) is a mechanism which allows us to traverse the records in the database.  You can think of it as a pointer to a record.  We'll use a cursor in the next example to get data from a predefined database.\n",

    "Again, this is just an introduction of how to get data to/from a database we are using SQLite as a portable and simple example. All the same principals apply even if you are connecting to a Microsoft SQL, Teradata, Oracle or other DBMS. But the connection mechanism for other databases can vary.  There are a few common libraries we can leverage such as [pyodbc](https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/wiki) and [pypyodbc](https://github.com/pypyodbc/pypyodbc).  [ODBC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/odbc/reference/what-is-odbc?view=sql-server-ver16) is a specification for a database API.  Nearly every commercial RDBMS supports connections and transactions using ODBC, meaning that to change between one database and another, the code changes very little - typcially the only thing that needs to change in the connection string and the precise SQL you are trying to execute.  Though that doesn't mean it is easy, connection strings are database platform dependent and can vary widely.  Here's [one source](https://www.connectionstrings.com/) that might help.\n",
