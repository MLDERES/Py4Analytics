# Part 2 - Intermediate Concepts

Once the simple concepts of decision making, flow control and code reuse are understood it becomes more clear how these can be combined together to solve complex problems with powerful algorithms.  This next section will explore some other tools that help to create these algorithms and expand the new way of thinking which allows humans to communicate with computers (and each other).
