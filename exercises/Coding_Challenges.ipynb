A tuple is a sequence of elements much like a list, but unlike a list, tuples are immutable (that is, they cannot be changed).  Tuples are represented by the parathenses surrounding a comma separated list of items such as (5,6) or ('mother', 'daughter').  In the first case, the tuple is made up of two integers and the second case the tuple is two strings.  Accessing items in a tuple is similar to accessing items in other sequences in Python - by using square brackets.\n",
