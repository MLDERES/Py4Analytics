    "# Reusing Code\n",

    "\n",
    "When you think about a simple task, like making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, you can tell your friend how to make that sandwich with just a few words.  For instance,\n",
    "- Grab the peanut butter\n",
    "- Choose the jelly\n",
    "- Open the bread\n",
    "- Spread the PB on one slice and the jelly on another piece of bread\n",
    "- Put the bread slices together with the PB and jelly touching\n",
    "\n",
    "We've really shortcutted a bunch of steps here right?  I mean, \"grabbing the peanut butter\" means going to the pantry, openning the door, finding the jar, selecting the jar, walking back...\n",
    "\n",
    "This would get very frustating if we had to explain this over and over for each kind of sandwich we want to make or with different kinds of jelly right?  So we have learned that, using words, we can communicate whole steps without having to break down the details each time.  We might have to provide a bit of context - say, if you're at my house, the PB is in the cabinet, but at your place it's in the pantry.  But in general humans can fill in the blanks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers can't fill in the blanks, we have to be very precise.  But we also don't want to have to be extremely precise everytime we want to do a simple task, so we use abstractions in programming to help us with the mundane.  One example, the `print()` statement we saw earlier.  There is a lot of stuff happening to make a couple of letters appear on the screen.  Fortunately for us, someone else figured this out already and we can rely on their work.  \n",

In these cases, we use another Python keyword `return`.  The `return` keyword says the function is complete and this bit of information is the result of the effort.  As a caller of the function we can use the returned value just like we use variables, we can assign it to variable for safe-keeping pass it along to another function or ignore it all together."

And if necessary, break that sub-step down into another function, keep going until each substep is understandable and does exactly one task, then combine the steps together into bigger subtasks.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>Functions allow us to reuse code.</b><br/> This is essential, because it saves us from typos, ensures that we are doing calculations and tasks consistently whereever it is used and even allows others to use our code without understanding how the subtask is executed.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>Functions encapsulate the variables keeping our \"namespace\" clean.</b><br/>  Since a, b, and c only contains values when the function is called, we can use the variable names a, b and c as parameters in other functions or in our main code without confusion.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>Functions allow us to test our program in small pieces.</b><br/>  If we can execute a part of our program correctly by calling just one function, then we can continue to build our program knowing that the building blocks are solid.</li></ol>"

    "<li><b>Documenting your function is a must.</b><br/>  You may not believe this now, but even the best programmers forget how their function is supposed to work or what it was supposed to do when the come back to use it a few days, months or years later.  The convention in Python is to write documentation comments immediately after the function definition.</li>\n",

Which format you choose is mostly up to you, although sometimes a project will already have defined the standard when you get to work on it.<div>\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "<li><b>Function names, and their parameters should be as descriptive as possible.</b><br/> While these examples above use parameter names like a and b (there is no reason to name them differently) the function names themselves immediately tell you the purpose and do exactly what you expect (add numbers, subtract numbers).</li>\n",
    "<li><b>Function names ought to use all lowercase letters and use '_' to separate words.</b><br/> If your function name is more than a single word, it is common practice (in Python, other languages differ) to separate the names with an `_` character.  For instance</li>\n",
