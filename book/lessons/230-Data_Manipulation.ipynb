In all of our examples, we'll use a pretty standard text format called (CSV) or comma-separated-values files.  This format is readable by nearly every statistical software package and by humans.  The first row is typically the name of the columns and each line of the file is a row of data with the values separated by commas.  The pandas library supports many different ways to load up a dataframe, which we will use as the primary mechanism for manipulating data in these notebooks.\n",
