    "# Gather data from the web\n",
    "As a data analyst, data is the fuel that drives the engine of discovery.  Often times this means using data we have collected with web forms, using external systems or via some business process.  Occassionally, we'll be given the data directly or we can download some data from a webpage that meets our needs.  Being able to gather data from sources on the web is a skill that is often very useful.  Wouldn't it be great if you could download [weather data predictions](https://www.abstractapi.com/api/weather#:~:text=What%20does%20the%20Weather%20API%20do%3F%20Abstract%27s%20Weather,and%20forecasted%20weather%20data%20for%20millions%20of%20locations.) as part of your morning routine, or grab [movies reviews](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/) to make plans for the weekend or even get data from the [James Webb Telescope](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/webb/about/index.html) so you can process your own images from outer space!\n",
    "\n",
    "Well fortunately you have most of the skills you need to do some of these things already.  In this notebook, we'll look at a few ways to get at data on the web, this is not comprehensive, but it should give you a start in the right direction.  One key skill this notebook leaves out is automating a webpage (like filling out a form or hitting a submit button) this automation takes a bit of extra setup and doesn't work well in a Jupyter notebook, but there are tools that can be helpful.  Check out [selenium](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/selenium-python-tutorial/) and [scrapy](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html) for a couple of approaches that use Python.\n",

    "## Simple Webscraping with Pandas\n",
    "Believe it or not, one of the simplest ways to get data from the web is to use `pandas`, the `read_html` function is fantastic and simple.  All we need is to install a couple libraries and then we can gather data from simpler web pages very quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first example, I went to [boxofficemojo.com](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/) and I selected a particular page where I saw some data I needed.  In this case, [Top Lifetime Grosses by MPAA Rating for PG-13 movies](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/chart/mpaa_title_lifetime_gross/?by_mpaa=PG-13&ref_=bo_cso_ac).  Looking at this page, I can see that there are about 200 movies on the first page.  This is enough for our purposes.  Next, I captured the URL (the link in the browser) and I use this to open with the `pandas` library.  Be careful, the result of the `read_html` method is a *list* of dataframes, so we'll have to know which one we are after.  In this particular case there is only one data frame, so we can use that one.\n"

So instead they built one web page and used parameters (yes!  just like function parameters in Python) which define the exact contents to display.
