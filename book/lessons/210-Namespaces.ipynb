    "A _module_ in Python is defined by the boundaries of a file with a `.py` extension.  Therefore a file named `my_file.py` becomes a _module_ called `my_file` as far as Python is concerned.  Similarly, if we want to define a function in the `my_file` module, we simply create the function in the `my_file.py` file.  This gives us the ability to have more than one top-level function with the same name in our program.\n",

    "Using the name of module and the function name over and over again can get a little redundant in our programs.  Python allows us to bring either an entire module or a particular function directly into our current namespace by using the `import` function.  The [import system](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html) in Python is incredibly powerful as it is the mechanism by which we can reuse code from larger libraries and share code across projects.\n",

    "## Packages\n",

    "\n",
    "You may have noticed this in other places in these notebooks.  There is a folder which has some helper functions in this in a `src` directory.  One such file is [data.py](../src/data.py).  In order to functions in that file, we use an `import` along with the name of the module and the element we want to import (e.g. variables, functions, classes, etc).  So that if we want to import the `remove_columns` function, we would do something like: (_realistically, there is a little more work that needs to happen, but this is close enough in order to make the point_)\n",
