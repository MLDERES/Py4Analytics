As we proceed to learning how python is used in data analysis, let's study some common methods used in pandas library for data manipulation (or data cleaning). It is importatnt to note that this list of methods are not exhastive. BEfore we delve in, what are methods in python?\n",

    "1. Drop: In a dataset there can be columns with missing values or data categories that are not useful for your analysis. Before dropping any columns with missing values, analyst have to. For example, you might have a New York city taxi dataset containing information (trip id, datetime, trip distance, payment types, passenger count) but want to focus on analyzing trip trends in a day. In this case, the payment tyoes and passenger count are not relevant for our analysis. Having them in our dataset will take up unnecessary space and processing time.\n",
