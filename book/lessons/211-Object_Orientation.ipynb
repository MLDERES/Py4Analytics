    "# Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to a paradigm in which software is organized around data (objects) rather than functions and logic.  An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behaviors. This will not be a lecture on OOP, but rather a focus on how OOP is manifest in Python, but in order to get there we have to levelset on a few key terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __class__ : defines the structure of an entity\n",
    "* __object__: the instantiation of a __class__\n",
    "* __member__: members of a __class__ include functions and properties\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, I can describe the characteristics of a dog.  A dog is a mammal that has a name, breed, fur and it barks.  hank, _is_ a dog, spot does not _define_ what a dog is.  This is the difference between a __class__ and an __object__.  A dog is the __class__, while Spot is represented by an __object__.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's relatively easy to decide the members of a __class__, we can simply look at the characteristics (breed, fur, and name) these are the _properties_ dogs and looking at the verbs (bark) we can identify the _functions_ (or more generally called methods)."
