# Student Contributions

Several students have experimented with Python to do some interesting projects.  Often times these experimentations lead to new insights and can be great examples for other students on similar journeys.  Those who wish to contribute should begin [here](01-contributing_a_notebook.md).

Following is the structure of the contributions section and a list of the contributions made so far.

## Folder layout
- `/book/contrib/` - folder for student notebooks
- `/book/contrib/contrib_data/` - data files to support student notebooks (prefer `.csv` or `.txt` files, SQLite3 okay)
- `/book/contrib/contrib_img/` - image files in support of student notebooks (prefer `.png`)
