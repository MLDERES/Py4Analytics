# Exercises
This section includes some notebooks which can be used to check what you've learned in the prior sections.  You can read these exercises as part of the book, but if you really want to work through these exercises then you will want to open these notebooks in the JupyterHub associated with this book.  When you are on a page that can be executed in the JupyterHub, you will see something like this 
````{figure} ../img/Link-Jupyter.png
:name: link_to_jupyter
:width: 40%
````
just above the title on the page.  When you select JupyterHub it will launch the page you are on in the hub so that you can run cells, add new cells and generally try out the materials.

````{contents}
