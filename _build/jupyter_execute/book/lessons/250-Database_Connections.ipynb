    "# Getting data from a database\n",
    "One common source of data, especially in institutions, is a relational database.  Microsoft SQL Server, Teradata, Oracle, Postgres, MySql are all examples of relational databases that in common use for storing and retrieving complex data.  Storing and retrieving data from these servers is a regular task in the life of an analyst because any process that does something interesting is likely to generate or ingest alot of data.  In this notebook, we'll look at the main components of a database connection, establish a connection and put some data into a simple database and read some data out the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "````{note}\n",

You wont need an in-depth understanding to work through this notebook, but if you want to brush up on some of the basics, this is [a good resources](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp)."

    "## SQLITE3\n",
    "Arguably one of the simplest relational databases to work with in is the [SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database.  It is one of the most used databases in the world.  It's built into every [mobile phone](https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html) and comes bundled in many applications people use on a regular basis.  It has many of the features of a more robust relational database, though it is all stored in a single portable file format.\n",

A database [cursor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursor_(databases)) is a mechanism which allows us to traverse the records in the database.  You can think of it as a pointer to a record.  We'll use a cursor in the next example to get data from a predefined database."

    "## Connecting to other RDBMS\n",
    "Again, this is just an introduction of how to get data to/from a database we are using SQLite as a portable and simple example. All the same principals apply even if you are connecting to a Microsoft SQL, Teradata, Oracle or other DBMS. But the connection mechanism for other databases can vary.  There are a few common libraries we can leverage such as [pyodbc](https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/wiki).  [ODBC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/odbc/reference/what-is-odbc?view=sql-server-ver16) is a specification for a database API.  Nearly every commercial RDBMS supports connections and transactions using ODBC, meaning that to change between one database and another, the code changes very little - typcially the only thing that needs to change in the connection string and the precise SQL you are trying to execute.  Though that doesn't mean it is easy, connection strings are database platform dependent and can vary widely.  Here's [one source](https://www.connectionstrings.com/) that might help.\n",
    "\n",
    "For SQL server, the connection string looks like:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "\"Driver=SQL Server Native Client 11.0;Server=myservername; Database=myDatabase; User Id=myUserName; Password=myPassword;\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connecting to MS SQL Server\n",
    "Most of the major RDBMS providers also provide python specific libraries if you know that you wont have to switch between different databases.  For instance, Microsoft provides [pymssql](http://www.pymssql.org/).  Using one of these libraries tends to make things a bit simpler if you just want to be able to do simple queries with a SQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "````{note} Environment Variables\n",
    "Environment variables are variables that are stored in the operating system, rather than in our program.  Environment variables provide a way to configure your application without having to edit your source code when the configuration changes. Common config items that are often passed to application through environment variables are third-party API keys, network ports, database servers, and any custom options that your application may need to work properly.  For more information on environment variables [see this fantastic resource](https://www.twilio.com/blog/environment-variables-python).\n",
    "\n",
