    "# Learning to program\n",
    "There are two primary challenges for people to learn to code:\n",
    "1. Thinking like a computer (we call this the algorithms)\n",
    "2. Understanding the words and symbols to use to tell the computer how to run the steps of the algorithm (syntax)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithms\n",
    "Algorithms are simply a set of steps required to complete a task.  We use algorithms all the time - for instance, the steps used to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich or something very complex such as framing a house.  Algorithms have a few different kinds of steps - for instance, we have steps for PREPARING, TASK EXECUTION, DECISION MAKING and REPEATING instructions.  Each of the steps can be general steps - like grabbing peanut butter from the cabinet or taking an action on a particular item such as OPEN the peanut butter jar.  Learning to think in this way is one of the first challenges for people learning to code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Syntax\n",
    "In order to make a computer complete the tasks that we desire, we need to talk in a language that can be understood by the computer.  This is called language syntax.  There are many different languages/syntaxes that humans can use to tell the computer what to do.  Python is the language we'll use because it reads alot like english and can become more intuitive with a few less symbols than other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often times, new learners, once they have successfully identified the algorithm that completes the task at hand, converting this algorithm to words, phrases and symbols that the computer understands is the second challenge.  These notebooks are focused on Python syntax, but students should constantly be on the lookout for the algorithms as well.  The algorithms used here are small/simple tasks - but they are often building blocks for more complex algorithms."

    "Okay, there are [many](https://medium.com/velotio-perspectives/the-ultimate-beginners-guide-to-jupyter-notebooks-6b00846ed2af), [many](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/05/jupyter-notebook-beginners-tutorial.html) valuable resources to learn the ins and outs of Jupyter notebooks, so I'll leave you to explore the many ways they can be used.  _If you are already a Python whiz_ try some of the [Coding Challenges](../exercises/Coding_Challenges.ipynb) or explore [Jupyter Notebook Tips,Tricks](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tips-tricks-shortcuts/). \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, one more thing before we get too far. You will see in many places, where there is non-computer code that gives other humans an idea of what is going on in the code. We call these pieces of text comments. Comments in Python start with a `#` symbol and tell the computer that everything following this symbol _on the current line_ is to be ignored. Comments are a valuable part of coding as they can help you to capture what you are trying to do (algorithm) before writing any code (syntax) and can be used once the code is in place to remember or clarify what exactly a bit of code is supposed to do. Here are a few examples of comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# this is the first comment\n",
    "spam = 1  # and this is the second comment\n",
    "          # ... and now a third!\n",
    "text = \"# This is not a comment because it's inside quotes.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "You will see comments sprinkled in among the examples, these don't need to be typed to make your code work, but it's a good idea to get in the habit early on so that you have good practice"

In order to do anything interesting (more complex algorithms) our code needs to be able to make decisions and execute different actions based on conditions - often many times over.  In the next notebook we'll look at how to get Python to make decisions and act on the results. \n",
