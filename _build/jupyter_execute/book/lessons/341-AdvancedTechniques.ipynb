    "## Feature Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Principal Components\n",
    "PCA is used to decompose a multivariate dataset in a set of successive orthogonal components that explain a maximum amount of the variance. In scikit-learn, PCA is implemented as a transformer object that learns components in its fit method, and can be used on new data to project it on these components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of the iris dataset, which is comprised of 4 features, projected on the 2 dimensions that explain most variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "![iris](../img/pca-iris.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means is that we can find a way to represent most of the variability described by some subset of the factors combined in a way as to keep the relative impact of each of the original factors but reduce the overall number of factors.  (Notice the chart doesn't have units because the eigenvectors that are used to establish the principal components aren't expressed in units, they are a combination of a group of factors.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps to computing PCA\n",
    "At the highest level the following are the steps involved in PCA:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Standardization of the dataset is a must before applying PCA because PCA is quite sensitive to the dataset that has a high variance in its values.\n",
    "2. Compute the covariance matrix\n",
    "3. Calculate Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors using the covariance matrix of the previous step to identify principal components.\n",
    "4. Sort the Eigenvalues and its Eigenvectors in descending order. Here the eigenvector with the highest value has the highest significance and forms the first principal component, and so on. So if we choose to take components n = 2, the top two eigenvectors will be selected.\n",
    "5. Transform the original matrix of data by multiplying it top n eigenvectors selected above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately the sklearn library manages all this for us, asking us only for the number of Principal Components we want (usually 2-3 is plenty)."

    "So far we have only dealt with a few parameters in our classifier and we used loops to try different values of `k` to determine the best number of neighbors for our model.  When we start to build up pipelines of estimators/classifiers/pre-processing which each have multiple parameters to tweak, if can be very difficult to keep track of combination of paramters that have been tried and which is the best.  The `sklearn` library has us covered.  In these cases we can use a [grid-search](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/grid_search.html#grid-search).\n",
    "\n",
    "A grid-search is used to tune the 'hyper-parameters' (that is parameters that are not learnt with estimators).  In other words they are the parameters to the constructor for each classification/estimator function.  A grid search is a cross-validation method whereby different combinations of all the parameters are attempted.  [GridSearchCV](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV) will try all the combinations exhaustively, while [RandomizedSearchCV](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV) can sample the set of parameter combinations.  Both of these tools have successive halving counterparts which can be a bit quicker at finding the right combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Before blindly attempting to brute force try all the combinations of different parameters it is best to consult each estimator/transformer to see which parameters have the greatest impact.  sklearn provies a good [best practice](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/grid_search.html#grid-search-tips)) guide which can help [avoid brute force parameter searches](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/grid_search.html#alternative-cv))"
