    "Notebooks are a handy way to combine code with text/explanations.  What's more, we can use notebooks to break up a program or analysis into several parts, running just one piece of code at a time.  For our purposes what this will do is allow us to look at a topic, execute some sample code to see how it works and then try writing something similar all in the same environment.\n",

    "So for a quick background.  Notebooks are broken up into 'cells'.  Each cell can be interpretted by the browser in many different ways, but for our purposes each cell is either a documentation (Markdown) cell or a code (Python) cell.  Each cell is 'run' or 'executed' by either pressing a key combination or selecting one of the buttons at the top of the page.  For instance to run a cell, select the cell by clicking you mouse on in the box, then press CTRL+Enter.  \n",
