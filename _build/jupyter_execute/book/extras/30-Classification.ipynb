    "## Assessing Predictive Performance\n",
    "Before we get too far into running algorithms we need a method to determine how good our model is.  There are a number of different metrics we might use.  But this depends on whether we are predicting/estimating a continuous target or a categorical target.  Some of the common methods are included here.\n",

    "and _precision_\n",
    "$$precision = \\frac{TruePositives}{TruePositives+FalsePositives}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Naive Performance\n",
    "The simplest way to determine if a model is valuable or not is to compare to the \"naive rule\".  In essense, if we predict the most common outcome every time what is the misclassification rate.  If our model is no better than this, then our model isn't very helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, let's say that in a list of 10 loan applicants that 8 of the applicants will be approved for a loan and that 2 won't be approved.  If we were to blindly assume that all 10 applicants would be approved for a loan - then we would be wrong 20% of the time (2/10).  Therefore, if we can't develop a model which is at least 80% accurate then we don't have a very good model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cut-off values for classification\n",
    "We also need to consider that in nearly all of our classification models, what we are given is the _probability_ or likelihood that the predicted target is in the given class, therefore the value we get from our classification algorithms is on a scale from 0 to 1.  Most often, the default is to say that a target belongs to a class if the probability of being in the class is > 0.5.  But it can be useful to move this cut-off.  For instance, if the cost of predicting a particular class is unusually high, we may want to raise the probability to 0.6 or greater."

    "* Still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.\n",

    "<br/>\n",
    "* If the number of features is much greater than the number of samples, avoid over-fitting in choosing Kernel functions and regularization term is crucial.\n",

The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. A tree can be seen as a piecewise constant approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some advantages of decision trees are:\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "* Simple to understand and to interpret. Trees can be visualised.\n",
    "* Requires little data preparation. Other techniques often require data normalisation, dummy variables need to be created and blank values to be removed. Note however that this module does not support missing values.\n",
    "* The cost of using the tree (i.e., predicting data) is logarithmic in the number of data points used to train the tree.\n",
    "* Able to handle both numerical and categorical data. However scikit-learn implementation does not support categorical variables for now. Other techniques are usually specialised in analysing datasets that have only one type of * variable. See algorithms for more information.\n",
    "* Able to handle multi-output problems.\n",
    "* Uses a white box model. If a given situation is observable in a model, the explanation for the condition is easily explained by boolean logic. By contrast, in a black box model (e.g., in an artificial neural network), results may be more difficult to interpret.\n",
    "* Possible to validate a model using statistical tests. That makes it possible to account for the reliability of the model.\n",

    "The disadvantages of decision trees include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that do not generalise the data well. This is called overfitting. Mechanisms such as pruning, setting the minimum number of samples required at a leaf node or setting the  maximum depth of the tree are necessary to avoid this problem.\n",
    "* Decision trees can be unstable because small variations in the data might result in a completely different tree being generated. This problem is mitigated by using decision trees within an ensemble.\n",
    "* Predictions of decision trees are neither smooth nor continuous, but piecewise constant approximations as seen in the above figure. Therefore, they are not good at extrapolation.\n",
    "* The problem of learning an optimal decision tree is known to be NP-complete under several aspects of optimality and even for simple concepts. Consequently, practical decision-tree learning algorithms are based on heuristic  algorithms such as the greedy algorithm where locally optimal decisions are made at each node. Such algorithms cannot guarantee to return the globally optimal decision tree. This can be mitigated by training multiple trees in an ensemble learner, where the features and samples are randomly sampled with replacement.\n",
    "* There are concepts that are hard to learn because decision trees do not express them easily, such as XOR, parity or multiplexer problems.\n",
    "* Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate. It is therefore recommended to balance the dataset prior to fitting with the decision tree."
